# EmployeeDatabase
Description:

  Epoch Systems of Anorev, Wi is a leading software firm. It often requires that employees visit customers to discuss implementation and integration issues. Such meetings are often called "Go Jive" sessions. To improve employee morale, Epoch has decided to allow employees to declare a "wish list" of destinations. Travel assignments will be matched against employee preferences (to the extent possible). Epoch is not quite ready to go live â€” it needs a way to manage employees and their wish lists. It has hired you to start working on a simple prototype.

  For this assignment you will write a program that constructs a simple database of employees and wish lists containing destinations encoded as airport identification codes (e.g., MSN or ORD). (Click here for a utility that maps airport names and their three letter codes). Your program will process a text file, specified as a command-line argument, using it to construct an employee database.

  For Programming Assignment 1 you will not be building an abstract data type (ADT) from scratch. Instead, you will use Java's ArrayList class to implement the EmployeeDatabase class specified below.

Goals:
The goals of this assignment are to:

    Practice compiling and running Java programs in Eclipse.
    Become familiar with Java's List interface by using Java's ArrayList class.
    Gain experience using iterators (from Java's Iterator interface) to traverse lists.
    Get practice throwing exceptions.
    Use command-line arguments.
    Review basic file and console I/O.
    Learn how Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are implemented in Java.
